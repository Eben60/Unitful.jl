# Pre-defined units and —Åonstants

In the following, only non-prefixed units are listed. To get a more detailed information about a unit, and to get information about prefixed units, use `Julia` help, e.g.

```
help?> Unitful.kW
  Unitful.kW

  A prefixed unit, equal to 10^3 W.

  Dimension: ùêã¬≤ ùêå ùêì‚Åª¬≥
